////////// PROBLEM 2 //////////

/*
  In the function below named greeting, it is receiving an object as a parameter. 
  Use object destructuring to save the object properties to new variables. 
  The property names are firstName, lastName, and title.

////////// PROBLEM 3 //////////

/*
  Write a function called totalPopulation that will take in an object.
  That object will have 4 properties named utah, california, texas and arizona.
  The property values will be numbers.

////////// PROBLEM 4 //////////

/*
  Write a function called ingredients that will take in an object. 
  This object will have 3 properties named carb, fat, and protein. 
  The property values will be strings. 
  Use object destructuring to save the property values to new variables.

////////// PROBLEM 5 //////////

/*
  Now we will use object destructuring as the function's parameter instead of destructuring the object inside of the function declaration.
  Example:
    function example( {one, two, three} ) {
      return one + two + three
    }

  Write a function called largeNumbers that will take a destructured object as it's parameter.
  The object properties will be named first, second, and third and their values will be numbers.
  Find the smallest number of the three and return that number.
